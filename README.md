## Raw data

Raw data is saved at: data/household_power_consumption.txt

Dataset: [Electric power consumption](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/exdata%2Fdata%2Fhousehold_power_consumption.zip)

Description: Measurements of electric power consumption in one household with a one-minute sampling rate over a period of almost 4 years. Different electrical quantities and some sub-metering values are available.

The following descriptions of the 9 variables in the dataset are taken from the UCI web site:

Date: Date in format dd/mm/yyyy

Time: time in format hh:mm:ss

Global_active_power: household global minute-averaged active power (in kilowatt)

Global_reactive_power: household global minute-averaged reactive power (in kilowatt)

Voltage: minute-averaged voltage (in volt)

Global_intensity: household global minute-averaged current intensity (in ampere)

Sub_metering_1: energy sub-metering No. 1 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to the kitchen, containing mainly a dishwasher, an oven and a microwave (hot plates are not electric but gas powered).

Sub_metering_2: energy sub-metering No. 2 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to the laundry room, containing a washing-machine, a tumble-drier, a refrigerator and a light.

Sub_metering_3: energy sub-metering No. 3 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to an electric water-heater and an air-conditioner.

## Subset of the data explored

How household energy usage varies over a 2-day period in February, 2007 (2007-02-01 and 2007-02-02).

## Plots

There are plot1.png, plot2.png, plot3.png, and plot4.png output of their R scripts with the same name. Every plot is a PNG file with a width of 480 pixels and a height of 480 pixels. The R scripts include code for reading the data so that the plot can be fully reproduced.

The assignment project requires to **reproduce the below example graphs**.
